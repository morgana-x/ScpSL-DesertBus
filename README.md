# Desert Bus ![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/morgana-x/ScpSL-DesertBus/total)
Exiled Plugin that adds desert bus as a custom gamemode.

# How to play:
Whichever poor sap decides to control the bus has to press E on the medkits (they are buttons) to control the bus
Steer left, right, accelerate and open doors just like the original desert bus!!!!

# Features:
+ Points system, get a point for every 360 miles driven
+ Bus
+ Road
+ I'm running out of features to put here!
+ Swerving off road if you're afk
+ Anti admin abuse / any fun at all

# Todo:
+ Improve bus model
+ Ingame speed dial, and distance meter 
+ Make points system save points across restarts
+ Stone
+ Maybe restart server every 360 miles
